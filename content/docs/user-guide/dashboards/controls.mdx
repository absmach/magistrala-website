Control Cards are interactive widgets that allow a user to send commands directly to connected devices through a selected channel. These cards provide an intuitive interface for real-time device control within the dashboard.

There are two types of Control Cards:

- **Switch Cards** – for sending boolean values (ON/OFF)

- **Slider Cards** – for sending numeric values (e.g., volume, power)

---

## Switch Card

The **Switch Card** allows a user to send boolean values (**true** or **false**) to a connected client via a channel. This is useful for devices that support simple on/off behavior, such as relays, motors, or lights.

### Create a Switch Card

To create a Switch Card:

1. Ensure the dashboard is in **Edit Mode**.
2. Click the Add Widget button and select **Switch**.
3. The **Create Switch dialog** will appear.

#### Configure the Switch Card

Configuration Fields:

- **Channel (*Required*)** - The channel to which the message is sent.
- **Client (*Required*)** - The target device receiving the command.
- **Value Name (*Required*)** - The name of the value being controlled (e.g., **volume**).
- **Subtopic** - Optional message subtopic.

Advanced Settings:

- **Title** - Optional label for the widget on the dashboard.
- **Switch Style** - Controls the visual style of the toggle:
  - **Button (Power icon)** – Displays a circular power button. The button turns green when the device is **ON**.
  - **Slide Toggle** – Displays a large horizontal slide switch that turns green when **ON**.

Once all fields are complete, click `Create`. The Switch Card will be added to the dashboard.

#### Use a Switch Card

After creation, the switch card shows:
- The configured **value name** at the top
- The toggle control in the center (power button or slide, depending on the chosen style)
- An **ON** / **OFF** status label at the bottom

The default state is **OFF**. Toggle the control to **ON** to send a `true` command to the client.

#### Switch Conclusion

Switch Cards are ideal for simple device control:

- Toggle ON/OFF commands
- Real-time interaction with devices
- Two visual styles: power button or slide toggle
- Configurable titles, value names, and channels

## Slider Control

The **Slider Card** allows a user to send numeric values to a connected device through a channel. It’s perfect for use cases such as adjusting **temperature**, **voltage**, or **fan speed**.

### Create a Slider Card

To create a Slider Card:

- Ensure the dashboard is in Edit Mode.
- Click the Add Widget button and select Slider.
- The Create Slider dialog will appear.

- **Value Name** (Required) – The metric being controlled (e.g., voltage).
- **Subtopic** – Optional subtopic for the message.
- **Unit** – The unit of measurement (e.g., L, °C, %, V).

Advanced Settings:

- **Title** – A custom title for the widget.
- **Minimum Value** – The lowest selectable value.
- **Maximum Value** – The highest selectable value.
- **Steps** – The value increment between slider positions.
- **Slider Color** – An optional color picker for the slider thumb. Leave empty to use the default primary color.
